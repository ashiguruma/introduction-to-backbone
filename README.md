Introduction to Backbone.js
===========================

A presentation on the basics of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org).

The best place to start is the slides, then the code, or just the code.

The JavaScript has been heavily commented so you can jump in at any point and work out what's going on. The best place to start is the index.html file.
